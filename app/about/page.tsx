        <h1>About HealthFuse</h1>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          HealthFuse is a healthcare technology company focused on building
          foundational digital infrastructure for healthcare systems across Africa.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          The company exists to address a critical challenge: fragmented systems
          that slow care delivery, increase administrative overhead, and weaken trust
          across the healthcare ecosystem.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          To enable secure, interoperable, and scalable healthcare systems by
          providing a unified digital layer that connects providers, payers,
          diagnostics, pharmacies, and regulators.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Our approach</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse takes an infrastructure-first approach — focusing on
          interoperability, verification, and governance rather than surface-level
          applications. This ensures long-term scalability and institutional trust.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Leadership</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse is led by operators with experience in business development,
          systems delivery, and multi-stakeholder partnerships across regulated
          environments.
        </p>
        
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
  HealthFuse was founded by Tochukwu Osuagwu, a business development
  and project delivery professional with over a decade of experience
  building and scaling systems across healthcare, infrastructure,
  and emerging markets.
