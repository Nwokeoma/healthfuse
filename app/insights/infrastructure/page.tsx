          Healthcare Doesn’t Need More Apps — It Needs Infrastructure
        </h1>
  
        <p className="italic mt-4">
          Building durable healthcare systems requires coordination, not novelty.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-6">
          Over the past decade, healthcare innovation has largely focused on
          applications — booking platforms, digital wallets, telemedicine tools,
          and patient-facing solutions. While these products solve narrow problems,
          they rarely address the deeper structural issues that slow healthcare
          delivery.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          The core challenge in healthcare is not a lack of innovation. It is a lack
          of shared infrastructure.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="mt-12 mb-4">Fragmentation is the real bottleneck</h2>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          Hospitals, laboratories, pharmacies, HMOs, and regulators often operate on
          separate systems with limited interoperability. Verification processes are
          repeated, claims are handled manually, and data moves slowly — if at all.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          This fragmentation creates delays, increases administrative cost, and
          erodes trust between institutions. Patients experience these failures as
          long wait times, repeated paperwork, and unclear payment processes.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="mt-12 mb-4">Infrastructure enables coordination</h2>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          Infrastructure is not visible to end users, but it determines how systems
          behave at scale. In healthcare, infrastructure enables institutions to
          verify information once, exchange data securely, and coordinate workflows
          without unnecessary duplication.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          Importantly, infrastructure does not replace existing systems. It connects
          them. It respects institutional boundaries while improving system-wide
          efficiency.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="mt-12 mb-4">Why this matters for emerging markets</h2>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          In emerging healthcare systems, the cost of fragmentation is even higher.
          Limited resources, uneven digitization, and regulatory complexity make
          coordination essential. Infrastructure-first approaches allow healthcare
          systems to scale responsibly without sacrificing oversight or trust.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          The future of healthcare will not be defined by the number of applications
          deployed, but by the quality of the infrastructure that connects them.
        </p>
