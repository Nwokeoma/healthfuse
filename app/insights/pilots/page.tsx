          Why Healthcare Pilots Fail — And How to Design Them Properly
        </h1>
  
        <p className="italic mt-4">
          Pilots should reduce risk and generate learning, not exhaust teams or
          create false signals.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-6">
          Pilots are often treated as a formality in healthcare technology
          deployments. A short test, a limited rollout, and a quick decision.
          In reality, poorly designed pilots create more confusion than clarity.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          When pilots fail, it is rarely because the technology did not work.
          It is usually because the pilot was not aligned with real workflows,
          incentives, or decision criteria.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="mt-12 mb-4">The most common pilot failures</h2>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          Many pilots fail because they attempt to test everything at once.
          Verification, claims, reporting, compliance, and user experience are
          bundled together without clear success metrics.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          Others fail because pilots are treated as sales demonstrations rather
          than operational experiments. In these cases, teams focus on impressions
          instead of outcomes.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="mt-12 mb-4">What effective pilots actually do</h2>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          Effective pilots are narrow by design. They focus on a small number of
          workflows, involve the right operational stakeholders, and define success
          before the pilot begins.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          A good pilot answers specific questions: Can verification be completed
          faster? Are claims cleaner? Does coordination improve? These signals
          matter more than surface-level adoption metrics.
        </p>
  
        <h2 className="mt-12 mb-4">Pilots as system alignment tools</h2>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          In healthcare, pilots are also alignment mechanisms. They bring together
          hospitals, payers, and regulators around shared workflows and expectations.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4">
          When designed properly, pilots reduce institutional risk while creating
          the foundation for responsible scaling.
        </p>

          HealthFuse approaches pilots as structured system-learning exercises,
          not product trials.
