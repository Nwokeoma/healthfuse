        <p style={{ marginTop: 20, fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          This page is for long-term investors interested in healthcare
          infrastructure, system-level platforms, and durable network effects.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          Healthcare in Africa is expanding rapidly, yet its digital infrastructure
          remains fragmented. HealthFuse is being built as a unifying layer that
          enables scale, trust, and coordination across the ecosystem.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Why HealthFuse</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Large, underserved healthcare markets</li>
          <li>Infrastructure-first approach, not point solutions</li>
          <li>Multi-stakeholder network effects</li>
          <li>High switching costs once embedded</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Why now</h2>
        <p>
          Policy reform, growing insurance penetration, and provider digitization
          are creating the conditions for shared healthcare infrastructure.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          HealthFuse is being built to occupy this layer — quietly, persistently,
          and at system scale.
        </p>
