        <h1>Investing in Healthcare Infrastructure</h1>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          Healthcare in Africa is expanding rapidly, yet its digital infrastructure
          remains fragmented. HealthFuse is being built to serve as the unifying
          digital layer that enables scale, trust, and efficiency across the
          healthcare ecosystem.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Why HealthFuse</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Large, underserved healthcare markets with growing demand</li>
          <li>Infrastructure-first approach rather than point solutions</li>
          <li>Multi-stakeholder network effects across providers and payers</li>
          <li>High switching costs once integrated</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Why now</h2>
        <p>
          Africa’s healthcare ecosystem is at an inflection point. Policy reforms,
          increased insurance penetration, and provider digitization are creating
          the conditions for a shared infrastructure layer.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          HealthFuse is being built to quietly occupy this layer — enabling
          interoperability, verification, and system-level coordination as the
          ecosystem matures.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Long-term vision</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse aims to become foundational infrastructure for healthcare
          systems across emerging markets — supporting millions of patients,
          thousands of providers, and a growing network of partners.
        </p>
