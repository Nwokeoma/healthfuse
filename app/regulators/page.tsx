        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          HealthFuse is designed to support national and sub-national healthcare
          systems by providing digital infrastructure that improves coordination,
          transparency, and system-wide efficiency.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          We recognize that healthcare delivery operates within complex regulatory,
          policy, and governance frameworks. HealthFuse is built to complement —
          not replace — existing institutions and oversight structures.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Our role</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse functions as a neutral infrastructure layer that enables
          secure interaction between healthcare providers, payers, diagnostic
          services, pharmacies, and oversight bodies.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          By standardizing verification and data exchange workflows, HealthFuse
          supports better system visibility, accountability, and policy execution
          without interfering in clinical or regulatory authority.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Alignment with public health objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Improving access to verified healthcare services</li>
          <li>Supporting insurance and reimbursement frameworks</li>
          <li>Reducing administrative friction across public and private providers</li>
          <li>Enhancing transparency and auditability</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Data governance & accountability</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse prioritizes data integrity, role-based access control,
          and traceability. System interactions are designed to be auditable
          and aligned with national data protection and health information policies.
        </p>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          As deployments expand, HealthFuse works collaboratively with regulators
          and government agencies to ensure compliance requirements are addressed
          proactively and transparently.

          <h2>Engagement model</h2>
          <p>
            Engagements with government and regulatory bodies typically begin
            with limited-scope pilots or policy-aligned initiatives focused on
            learning, validation, and system improvement.
