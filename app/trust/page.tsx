        <p>
          Patient data is protected through strict access controls, encryption,

          sensitive information.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Compliance by design</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse is built to align with national healthcare regulations,
          insurance guidelines, and data protection frameworks across Africa.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Audit & accountability</h2>
        <p>
          Every transaction and verification event is traceable, enabling
          transparency, dispute resolution, and system accountability.
