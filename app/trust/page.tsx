        <h1>Trust, Security & Governance</h1>
  
        <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
          Healthcare systems rely on trust. HealthFuse is designed with security,
          data integrity, and regulatory alignment at its core.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Data protection</h2>
        <p>
          Patient data is protected through strict access controls, encryption,
          and audit logging — ensuring only authorized entities interact with
          sensitive information.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Compliance by design</h2>
        <p>
          HealthFuse is built to align with national healthcare regulations,
          insurance guidelines, and data protection frameworks across Africa.
        </p>
  
        <h2 style={{ marginTop: 40 }}>Audit & accountability</h2>
        <p>
          Every transaction and verification event is traceable, enabling
          transparency, dispute resolution, and system accountability.
        </p>

        <section style={{ marginTop: 60 }}>
  <h2>Built for regulated environments</h2>

  <p>
    HealthFuse is designed with the realities of regulated healthcare
    environments in mind. System architecture prioritizes data integrity,
    role-based access, traceability, and operational accountability.
  </p>

  <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
    As HealthFuse scales, the platform aligns with national healthcare policies,
    insurance frameworks, and data protection regulations — ensuring compliance
    is embedded into system design, not added as an afterthought.
  </p>

<section style={{ marginTop: 60 }}>
  <h2>Governance & regulatory alignment</h2>

  <p>
    HealthFuse operates with the understanding that healthcare systems
    exist within strict regulatory, ethical, and governance frameworks.
  </p>

  <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
    Our platform is designed to support alignment with national health
    authorities, insurance regulators, and data protection agencies.
    This includes clear audit trails, defined data access roles, and
    system-level accountability.
  </p>

  <p style={{ marginTop: 20 }}>
    As deployments expand, HealthFuse works collaboratively with
    ecosystem stakeholders to ensure compliance requirements are
    addressed proactively and transparently.
